1.  <stdint.h> is a header file that allows the use of typedefs and macros
2.  uint8_t stands for unsigned char
    uint32_t stands for unsigned long
    int32_t stands for long
    uint16_t stands for unsigned short
    These are typedefs defined in <stdint.h> which are used to fill spaces in a file.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte (8 bits)
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes
4.  Hex = 0x424d
    Decimal = 19778
    ASCII = BM
5.  bisize : size of BITMAPINFOHEADER (value = 40)
    bfsize : size of the whole bmp file
6.  Negetive biHeight indicates that the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  Ans : biBitCount
8.  fopen returns null if the file does not exist
9.  This is because we move the file pointer by 1*sizeof structure 
10. The padding would become 3
11. Moves the file pointer to a specific location
12. Moves the file pointer to a defined offset from the current position.
